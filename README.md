# Decentralized Will & Inheritance System

## üìå Project Overview

The **Decentralized Will & Inheritance System** is a smart contract that automates the distribution of assets upon the owner's inactivity for a predefined period. This removes the need for intermediaries like lawyers and ensures a **trustless, secure, and automated** inheritance process.

## üéØ Features

- **Decentralized Will Creation** ‚Äì Define beneficiaries and their asset allocation.
- **Proof-of-Life Mechanism** ‚Äì Owner must check in periodically to confirm activity.
- **Automated Fund Distribution** ‚Äì If the owner is inactive beyond the threshold, assets are transferred to beneficiaries.
- **Tamper-Proof & Trustless** ‚Äì Once executed, the will cannot be altered.
- **ETH Deposits** ‚Äì The contract holds and distributes Ether upon execution.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Solidity** ‚Äì Smart contract development.
- **Ethereum Blockchain** ‚Äì Secure execution of inheritance logic.
- **Ethers.js** ‚Äì Frontend integration (optional).
- **Chainlink Keepers** (Optional) ‚Äì Automate inactivity checks.

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Contract

- Set the `_inactivityThreshold` in seconds (e.g., 6 months = `15552000` seconds).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deposit Funds

- Send ETH to the contract address to be distributed later.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Define Beneficiaries

- Call `updateWill(address[], uint256[])` with:
  - A list of beneficiary addresses.
  - Corresponding percentage shares (must total 100%).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Owner Must Check-In

- The owner must call `confirmActivity()` before the inactivity threshold expires to reset the timer.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ If the Owner Becomes Inactive

- Any user can call `distributeFunds()`, which:
  - Divides and transfers ETH to beneficiaries.
  - Marks the will as executed.

## üìú Smart Contract Functions

### **üë§ Owner Functions**

- `updateWill(address[], uint256[])` ‚Äì Define or update beneficiaries and allocation.
- `confirmActivity()` ‚Äì Updates the last check-in timestamp.

### **‚è≥ Inactivity Handling**

- `distributeFunds()` ‚Äì Checks if the owner is inactive and distributes assets.
- `receive()` ‚Äì Allows the contract to receive ETH deposits.

                      v
            +----------------------+
            |  Owner Calls confirmActivity()  |
            |  (To Confirm They Are Active)  |

  +----------------+      +----------------+
                                    |
                                    v
                          +----------------------+
                          | Any User Calls       |
                          | distributeFunds()    |
                          +----------------------+
                                    |
                                    v
                          +----------------------+
                          | Smart Contract       |

                          | Beneficiaries Can    |
                          | Withdraw Their Share |
                          +----------------------+
How It Works?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Owner deploys contract and registers beneficiaries.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Owner must check in periodically by calling confirmActivity().
3Ô∏è‚É£ If owner is inactive beyond the threshold, the timer expires.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Any user can trigger distributeFunds(), executing the will.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Smart contract automatically transfers assets to beneficiaries.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Beneficiaries can withdraw their inheritance.

## üîê Security Considerations

- **Owner must check in periodically** to prevent unintended fund distribution.
- **Total percentage must be 100%** when setting beneficiaries.
- **Funds are locked until execution** ‚Äì No early withdrawals.

## üì¶ Deployment & Testing

1. Deploy the contract via **Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry**.
2. Fund the contract with ETH.
3. Set beneficiaries and percentages.
4. Call `confirmActivity()` periodically.
5. Test `distributeFunds()` by simulating inactivity.
